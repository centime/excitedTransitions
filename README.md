Siteswap transitions modelization

This script uses the vanilla siteswap notation (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap#Vanilla ) which assumes that only
one object is thrown at a time.

It generates transitions between the ground state and excited state
patterns and will bring the simplest sequences to enter and exit the
excited pattern.

Example :
771
66(771)3


If you fail in informing correctly the excited pattern, some corrections
will be proposed.

Example :
7715
Invalid siteswap sequence, you could try one of theses :
666(7175)2
6(7571)4
etc.


Let's juggling!
